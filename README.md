# Vending Maching Test In React Native

## Steps to run the app (Tested only on Android because I do not have a Mac to test it in IOS):

1. Clone repository using: git clone https://github.com/engineerStuardo/focusVendingMachineTest.git
2. Then you need to got to the folder where you clone the repository.
3. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the command: npm i
4. Finally run the next command to test the app in Android Simulator: npx react-native run-android

## Also you can find apk in /android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
